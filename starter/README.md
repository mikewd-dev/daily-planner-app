# daily-planner-app

## Description

- This application is a daily planner. The planner is based on a 9-5 working day. Each section/hour is colour-coded depending on the time, i.eon colour for past times, another for the present time and another for future times.

-I used HTML, CSS as well as JQuery and Day.JS to create this application.

- I learned how to use third party apis such as jquery to manipulate the DOM and day.js for time operations.
